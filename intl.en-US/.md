# What is an EIP?

This topic provides an overview of Elastic IP Address. An elastic IP address \(EIP\) is a public IP address that you can purchase and hold as an independent resource. You can associate an EIP with an Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instance deployed in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\), an internal Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instance deployed in a VPC, or a secondary elastic network interface \(ENI\) attached to a VPC. You can also associate an EIP with a NAT gateway, or a High-Availability Virtual IP Address \(HAVIP\).

An EIP is also a NAT IP address that is provisioned in a public-facing gateway of Alibaba Cloud and is mapped to the associated cloud resource with NAT. After an EIP is associated with a cloud resource, the cloud resource can connect to the Internet by using this EIP.

## Line types

EIP supports the line types of BGP \(Multi-ISP\) and BGP \(Multi-ISP\) Pro. The following table lists the differences between BGP \(Multi-ISP\) and BGP \(Multi-ISP\) Pro.

|Item|BGP \(Multi-ISP\)|BGP \(Multi-ISP\) Pro|
|----|-----------------|---------------------|
|Advantages|BGP \(Multi-ISP\) provides high-quality and high-bandwidth BGP lines. -   Up to 89 high-quality BGP lines are available worldwide.
-   Direct connections can be established in all regions of mainland China through lines of the following Internet Service Providers \(ISPs\): China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile, China Mobile Tietong, China Netcom, China Education and Research Network \(CERNET\), National Radio and Television Administration, Dr. Peng Telecom & Media Group, and Founder Broadband Network.
-   You can use BGP \(Multi-ISP\) with EIP bandwidth plans to obtain higher bandwidth \(up to 100 Gbit/s\).

|BGP \(Multi-ISP\) Pro has all the advantages of BGP \(Multi-ISP\). Compared with BGP \(Multi-ISP\), when BGP \(Multi-ISP\) Pro provides services to clients in mainland China \(excluding data centers\), cross-border connections are established without using international ISP services. This reduces network latency.|

## Benefits

EIPs have the following benefits:

-   Independent purchase and possession

    You can purchase and hold an EIP as an independent resource. EIPs are not bundled with other computing or storage resources.

-   Flexible association

    You can dissociate an EIP from a cloud resource and then release the EIP if the EIP is no longer needed. This prevents unexpected charges on your account.

-   Configurable network capabilities

    You can adjust the peak bandwidth of an EIP at any time. The bandwidth changes take effect immediately.
