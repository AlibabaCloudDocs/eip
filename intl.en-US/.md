# Limits

This topic describes the limits on the use of elastic IP addresses \(EIPs\). We recommend that you read and understand these limits before you use EIPs.

## General limits

The following general limits apply to EIPs:

-   You can apply for up to 20 EIPs with each account.

    Go to the [Quota Management](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/quota) to increase the quota. For more information, see [Quota management](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Quota management.md).

-   An EIP can be associated with only one cloud resource. The associated EIP must be in the Available state. The configuration immediately takes effect after the association.
-   EIPs that are locked for security reasons cannot be released, associated with, or disassociated from other cloud resources.
-   The following table lists the bandwidth limits on EIPs.

    |Pay-by-data-transfer EIPs|Pay-by-bandwidth EIPs|
    |-------------------------|---------------------|
    |Each pay-by-data-transfer EIP supports a maximum bandwidth of 200 Mbit/s. This value indicates the upper limit of bandwidth usage and is intended for informational purposes only. It is not a guaranteed performance and is for reference only. In scenarios where demands exceed resource supplies, the maximum bandwidth may be limited.|Each pay-by-bandwidth EIP supports a maximum bandwidth of 500 Mbit/s. This value is a guaranteed performance of the service. In scenarios where demands exceed resource supplies, the maximum bandwidth is guaranteed.|
    |The sum of the maximum bandwidth of all pay-by-data-transfer EIPs in a single region cannot exceed 5 Gbit/s. If your business requires a guaranteed or larger maximum bandwidth, you must purchase pay-by-bandwidth EIPs.|The sum of the maximum bandwidth of all pay-by-bandwidth EIPs in a single region cannot exceed 50 Gbit/s. You can contact your product manager to increase the quota.|

-   The following limits apply to the inbound and outbound bandwidth for EIPs purchased after 00:00 \(UTC+8\) on February 15, 2020:
    -   Inbound bandwidth
        -   If you purchase an EIP with a maximum bandwidth of at least 10 Mbit/s, Alibaba Cloud allocates the inbound bandwidth that equals to the maximum bandwidth to the EIP.
        -   If you purchase an EIP with a maximum bandwidth that is lower than 10 Mbit/s, Alibaba Cloud allocates an inbound bandwidth of 10 Mbit/s to the EIP.
    -   Outbound bandwidth

        Alibaba Cloud allocates the outbound bandwidth that equals the maximum bandwidth to the EIP.


## Limits on associating an EIP with an ECS instance

Note the following limits before you associate an EIP with an Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instance:

-   The ECS instance must be deployed in a Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) network.
-   The ECS instance and the EIP must be deployed in the same region.
-   The ECS instance must be in the Running or Stopped state.
-   The ECS instance is not associated with a public IP address or another EIP.
-   An ECS instance can be associated with only one EIP. If you want to associate multiple EIPs with an ECS instance, you can associate the EIPs with a secondary Elastic Network Interface \(ENI\). Then, you can associate the secondary ENI with the ECS instance. For more information, see [Associate an ECS instance with multiple EIPs](/intl.en-US/FAQ/FAQ.md).

## Limits on associating an EIP with a NAT gateway

Note the following limits before you associate an EIP with a NAT gateway:

-   No NAT bandwidth plan was purchased under the account to which the NAT gateway belongs before January 26, 2018.
-   The NAT gateway and the EIP must be deployed in the same region.
-   A NAT gateway can be associated with at most 20 EIPs.

    You can go to the [Quota Management](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/quota) to increase the quota. For more information, see [Quota management](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Quota management.md).


## Limits on associating an EIP with an SLB instance

Note the following limits before you associate an EIP with a Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instance:

-   The SLB instance must be deployed in a VPC network.
-   The SLB instance and the EIP must be deployed in the same region.
-   An SLB instance can be associated with only one EIP.

## Limits on associating an EIP with a secondary ENI

Note the following limits before you associate an EIP with a secondary ENI:

-   The secondary ENI must be attached to a VPC network.
-   The secondary ENI and the EIP must be deployed in the same region.
-   You can associate an EIP with a secondary ENI in one of the following modes: NAT mode, cut-through mode, and multi-EIP to ENI mode.
    -   In NAT mode, the number of EIPs with which a secondary ENI can be associated depends on the number of private IP addresses of the secondary ENI.
    -   In cut-through mode, a secondary ENI can be associated with only one EIP.
    -   In multi-EIP to ENI mode, a secondary ENI can be associated with at most 10 EIPs. To increase the quota, [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ticket/createIndex).
