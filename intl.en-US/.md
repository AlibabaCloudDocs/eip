# What is an EIP?

This topic provides an overview of Elastic IP Address. An elastic IP address \(EIP\) is a public IP address that you can purchase and hold as an independent resource. You can associate an EIP with an Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instance deployed in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\), an internal Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instance deployed in a VPC, or a secondary elastic network interface \(ENI\) attached to a VPC. You can also associate an EIP with a NAT gateway, or a High-Availability Virtual IP Address \(HAVIP\).

An EIP is also a NAT IP address that is provisioned in a public-facing gateway of Alibaba Cloud and is mapped to the associated cloud resource with NAT. After an EIP is associated with a cloud resource, the cloud resource can connect to the Internet by using this EIP.

## Differences between an EIP and a public IP address of an ECS instance

The following table compares the features of an EIP with those of a public IP address of an ECS instance.

|Feature|EIP|ECS public IP address|
|:------|:--|:--------------------|
|Supported networks|VPC|VPC and classic network|
|Support for being held as an independent resource|Yes|No|
|Support for being associated with and disassociated from an ECS instance at any time|Yes|No|
|Support for being displayed in the ENI information of the associated ECS instance|The IP address is displayed in the ENI information if it is associated with the ENI in the **cut-through mode**or **multi-EIP to ENI mode**|Classic network: Yes

 VPC: No |

## Benefits

EIPs have the following benefits:

-   Independent purchase and possession

    You can purchase and hold an EIP as an independent resource. EIPs are not bundled with other computing or storage resources.

-   Flexible association

    You can dissociate an EIP from a cloud resource and then release the EIP if the EIP is no longer needed. This prevents unexpected charges on your account.

-   Configurable network capabilities

    You can adjust the peak bandwidth of an EIP at any time. The bandwidth changes take effect immediately.
