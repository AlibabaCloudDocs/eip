# Limits

Elastic IP Address \(EIP\) imposes limits on its features. We recommend that you understand the limits before you use the features.

## General limits

The following general limits apply to EIPs:

-   You can apply for up to 20 EIPs for each Alibaba Cloud account.

    You can navigate to the [Quota Management](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/quota) page to increase the quota. For more information, see [Quota management](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Quota management.md).

-   An EIP can be associated with only one cloud resource and the EIP to be associated must be in the Available state. An EIP takes effect immediately after it is associated with a cloud resource.
-   EIPs that are locked for security reasons cannot be released, associated with cloud resources, or disassociated from cloud resources.
-   The following table describes the bandwidth limits on EIPs.

    |Pay-by-data-transfer EIPs|Pay-by-bandwidth EIPs|
    |-------------------------|---------------------|
    |Each pay-by-data-transfer EIP supports a maximum bandwidth value of 200 Mbit/s. This value indicates the upper limit of bandwidth usage. It is for reference only and is not a guaranteed value. In scenarios where demands exceed resource supplies, the maximum bandwidth may be limited.|Each pay-by-bandwidth EIP supports a maximum bandwidth value of 500 Mbit/s. The maximum bandwidth value is guaranteed. In scenarios where demands exceed resource supplies, the maximum bandwidth is guaranteed.|
    |The sum of the peak bandwidth values of all pay-by-data-transfer EIPs in each region cannot exceed 5 Gbit/s. If your business requires a guaranteed bandwidth value or a larger bandwidth value, you must purchase pay-by-bandwidth EIPs.|The sum of the peak bandwidth values of all pay-by-bandwidth EIPs in each region cannot exceed 50 Gbit/s. You can contact the product manager to increase the quota.|

-   The following limits apply to the inbound and outbound bandwidth for EIPs that were purchased after 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on February 15, 2020:
    -   Inbound bandwidth \(data is transmitted to EIPs\)
        -   If you purchase an EIP with a maximum bandwidth value of at least 10 Mbit/s, the inbound bandwidth value allocated to the EIP equals the maximum bandwidth value of the EIP.
        -   If you purchase an EIP with a maximum bandwidth value that is lower than 10 Mbit/s, the inbound bandwidth value allocated to the EIP is 10 Mbit/s.
    -   Outbound bandwidth \(data is transmitted from EIPs\)

        The outbound bandwidth value allocated to an EIP equals the maximum bandwidth value of the EIP.


## Limits on associating an EIP with an ECS instance

Take note of the following limits before you associate an EIP with an Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instance:

-   The ECS instance must be deployed in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\).
-   The ECS instance and the EIP must be deployed in the same region.
-   The ECS instance must be in the Running or Stopped state.
-   The ECS instance is not associated with a static public IP address or another EIP.
-   Each ECS instance can be associated with only one EIP. If you want to associate multiple EIPs with an ECS instance, you can associate the EIPs with a secondary elastic network interface \(ENI\) and associate the secondary ENI with the ECS instance. For more information, see [Associate multiple EIPs with an ECS instance]().

## Limits on associating an EIP with a NAT gateway

Take note of the following limits before you associate an EIP with a NAT gateway:

-   Before January 26, 2018, no NAT bandwidth plan was purchased under the Alibaba Cloud account to which the NAT gateway belongs.
-   The NAT gateway and the EIP must be deployed in the same region.
-   You can associate a NAT gateway with at most 20 EIPs, among which up to 10 pay-by-data-transfer EIPs can be associated.

    You can navigate to the [Quota Management](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/quota) page to request a quota increase. For more information, see [Quota management](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Quota management.md).


## Limits on associating an EIP with an SLB instance

Take note of the following limits before you associate an EIP with a Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instance:

-   The SLB instance must be deployed in a VPC.
-   The SLB instance and the EIP must be deployed in the same region.
-   Each SLB instance can be associated with only one EIP.

## Limits on associating an EIP with a secondary ENI

Take note of the following limits before you associate an EIP with a secondary ENI:

-   The secondary ENI must be deployed in a VPC.
-   The secondary ENI and the EIP must be deployed in the same region.
-   You can associate an EIP with a secondary ENI in one of the following modes: NAT mode, cut-through mode, and multi-EIP to ENI mode.
    -   In NAT mode, the number of EIPs with which a secondary ENI can be associated depends on the number of private IP addresses of the secondary ENI.
    -   In cut-through mode, each secondary ENI can be associated with only one EIP.
    -   In multi-EIP to ENI mode, each secondary ENI can be associated with at most 10 EIPs. To increase the quota,[submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ticket/createIndex).

## Limits on Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\)

Starting from 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on December 22, 2020, you can no longer purchase **BGP \(Multi-ISP\) International** in the China \(Hong Kong\) region. **BGP \(Multi-ISP\) International** that were purchased before 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on December 22, 2020 are not affected.
