# Reinstate a released EIP {#task_gzr_j35_cgb .task}

You can reinstate a released Elastic IP Address \(EIP\) based on the IP address or ID of the EIP. However, if the released EIP has been allocated to another user, you cannot reinstate it.

The default peak bandwidth of the reinstated EIP is 5 Mbit/s and the EIP adopts the Pay-As-You-Go billing method \(billing based on traffic\).

**Note:** You can reinstate EIPs 20 times per month at most. To apply for an increase to your quota, open a ticket.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/vpc).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Elastic IP Addresses**.
3.  Select the region of the target EIP.
4.  On the Elastic IP Addresses page, click **Request Specific EIP**.
5.  Select a method to reinstate a released EIP: 
    -   Click the **Request by IP Address** tab, enter the IP address of the EIP to be reinstated, and click **OK**.
    -   Click the **Request by EIP Instance ID** tab, enter the instance ID of the EIP to be reinstated and click **OK**.
