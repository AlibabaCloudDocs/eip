# Reinstate a released EIP {#task_gzr_j35_cgb .task}

This topic describes how to reinstate a released Elastic IP Address \(EIP\) by IP address or instance ID.

After you reinstate a released EIP, its default peak bandwidth is 5 Mbit/s and the EIP uses the Pay-As-You-Go billing method \(billed by traffic\).

**Note:** Released EIPs under each account can be reinstated up to 20 times per month. To increase the quota, open a ticket.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/vpc).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Elastic IP Addresses**.
3.  Select the region of the target EIP.
4.  On the Elastic IP Addresses page, click **Request Specific EIP**.
5.  Select either of the following methods to reinstate a released EIP: 
    -   Click the **Request by IP Address** tab, enter the IP address of the EIP to be reinstated, and click **OK**.
    -   Click the **Request by EIP Instance ID** tab, enter the instance ID of the EIP to be reinstated, and click **OK**.
