# Release an EIP {#task_592765 .task}

This topic describes how to release an Elastic IP Address \(EIP\). After you release an EIP, no fees are charged on the EIP.

Before you release an EIP, make sure that the following conditions are met:

-   The billing method of the EIP to be released must be Pay-As-You-Go. Subscription-billed EIPs cannot be released.
-   The EIP is not associated with any cloud instances. If the EIP is associated with a cloud instance, disassociate the EIP first. For more information, see [Disassociate an EIP from a cloud instance](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Disassociate an EIP from a cloud instance.md#).

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/vpc).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Elastic IP Addresses**.
3.  Select the region of the target EIP.
4.  On the Elastic IP Addresses page, find the target EIP, and choose **More** \> **Release** in the **Actions** column.
5.  In the displayed dialog box, click **OK**.
