# Create an EIP {#task_bh5_dll_vdb .task}

You can create an Elastic IP Address \(EIP\) and associate it with an ECS or SLB instance of the VPC network, or a NAT Gateway. The EIP then acts as a public IP address to provide the resource with Internet access.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://vpcnext.console.aliyun.com). 
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Elastic IP Addresses** and then click **Create EIP**. 
3.  Configure the EIP according to the following information, and then click **Buy Now** to complete the payment. 

    |Configuration|Description|
    |:------------|:----------|
    |**Region**| Select the region of the EIP to be created.

 Make sure that the EIP and the resource with which you want to associate it are in the same region.

    |**Network Traffic**|The EIP is billed based on traffic. For more information, see [Billing method](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing method.md#).|
    |**Max Bandwidth**|Set a peak bandwidth for the EIP.|
    |**Quantity**|Select the number of EIPs you want to create with the same configurations.|
