# Create an EIP {#task_bh5_dll_vdb .task}

You can create an Elastic IP Address \(EIP\), then bind it to an ECS or SLB instance of the VPC network, or a NAT Gateway. The EIP then acts as a public IP to provide the resource with Internet access.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://vpcnext.aliyun.console.com). 
2.  Click **Create EIP**. 
3.  Configure the EIP according to the following information, and then click **Buy Now** to complete the payment. 

    |Configuration|Description|

    |**Network traffic**|The EIP is charged by traffic usage. For more information, see [Pay-As-You-Go billing](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Pay-As-You-Go billing.md#).|
    |**Max Bandwidth**|Set a peak bandwidth for the EIP.|
