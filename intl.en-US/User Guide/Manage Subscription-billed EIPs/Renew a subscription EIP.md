# Renew a subscription EIP

This topic describes how to renew a subscription elastic IP address \(EIP\).

A subscription EIP is retained seven days after the EIP expires. If you do not renew the EIP within the seven days, the EIP is automatically released.

1.  Log on to the [Elastic IP Address console](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/eip).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where the EIP is deployed.

3.  On the Elastic IP Addresses page, find the EIP that you want to renew and choose **![More](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1382169951/p143776.png)** \> **Renew** in the **Actions** column.
