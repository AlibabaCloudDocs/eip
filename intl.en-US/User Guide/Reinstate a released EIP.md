# Reinstate a released EIP {#task_gzr_j35_cgb .task}

You can reinstate a released Elastic IP Address \(EIP\) based on the IP address or ID of the EIP. If the released EIP has been allocated to another user, you cannot reinstate it.

The default peak bandwidth of the reinstated EIP is 5 Mbit/s and the EIP adopts the Pay-As-You-Go billing method \(billing based on traffic\).

**Note:** You can reinstate EIPs a maximum of 20 times per month. To request an increase of your quota, open a ticket.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://partners-intl.aliyun.com/login-required#/vpc). 
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Elastic IP Addresses** and then click **Request Specific EIP**. 
3.  Select a method to reinstate a released EIP: 
    -   Click **Request by IP Address**, enter the IP address of the EIP, and click **OK** to reinstate the EIP.
    -   Click **Request by EIP Instance ID**, enter the instance ID of the EIP and click **OK** to reinstate the EIP.
