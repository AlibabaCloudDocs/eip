# Overview

This topic describes the line types of Elastic IP Address \(EIP\). An EIP is a public IP address resource that you can purchase and hold as an independent resource.

## Line types

EIP supports the line types of BGP \(Multi-ISP\) and BGP \(Multi-ISP\) Pro. The following table lists the differences between BGP \(Multi-ISP\) and BGP \(Multi-ISP\) Pro.

|Item|BGP \(Multi-ISP\)|BGP \(Multi-ISP\) Pro|
|----|-----------------|---------------------|
|Advantages|BGP \(Multi-ISP\) provides high-quality and high-bandwidth BGP lines. -   Up to 89 high-quality BGP lines are available worldwide.
-   Direct connections can be established in all regions of mainland China through lines of the following Internet Service Providers \(ISPs\): China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile, China Mobile Tietong, China Netcom, China Education and Research Network \(CERNET\), National Radio and Television Administration, Dr. Peng Telecom & Media Group, and Founder Broadband Network.
-   You can use BGP \(Multi-ISP\) with EIP bandwidth plans to obtain higher bandwidth \(up to 100 Gbit/s\).

|BGP \(Multi-ISP\) Pro has all the advantages of BGP \(Multi-ISP\). Compared with BGP \(Multi-ISP\), when BGP \(Multi-ISP\) Pro provides services to clients in China \(excluding data centers\), cross-border connections are established without using international ISP services. This reduces network latency.|
