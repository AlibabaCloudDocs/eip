# Disassociate an EIP from a cloud resource

This topic describes how to disassociate an elastic IP address \(EIP\) from a cloud resource when Internet access is no longer needed. An EIP that is disassociated from a cloud resource still incurs retention costs.

1.  Log on to the [EIP console](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/eip).

2.  In the upper-left corner, select the region where your EIP is created.

3.  On the **Elastic IP Addresses** page, find the EIP that you want to disassociate, and click **Unbind** in the **Actions** column.

4.  In the message that appears, click **OK**.
