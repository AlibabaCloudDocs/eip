# Disassociate an EIP from a cloud resource

This topic describes how to disassociate an elastic IP address \(EIP\) from a cloud resource when Internet access is no longer needed. An EIP that is disassociated from a cloud resource still incurs retention costs.

1.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where the EIP is deployed.

2.  On the **Elastic IP Addresses** page, find the EIP that you want to disassociate, and click **Unbind** in the **Actions** column.

3.  In the message that appears, click **OK**.
