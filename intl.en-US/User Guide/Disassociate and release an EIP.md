# Disassociate and release an EIP {#task_bh5_dll_vdb .task}

You can disassociate and release an Elastic IP Address \(EIP\) when the EIP is no longer required. After an EIP is disassociated from cloud instances, you still need to pay the retention fee. To avoid unnecessary cost, we recommend that you release the EIP after disassociating it from cloud instances.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/vpc). 
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Elastic IP Addresses**. 
3.  Select the region of the target EIP. 
4.  Find the target EIP, click **Unbind**, and then click **OK** in the displayed dialog box. 
5.  Return to the EIP list page, choose **More** \> **Release** and then click **OK** in the displayed dialog box to release the EIP.
