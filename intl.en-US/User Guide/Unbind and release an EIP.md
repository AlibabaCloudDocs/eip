# Unbind and release an EIP {#task_bh5_dll_vdb .task}

You can unbind and release an Elastic IP Address \(EIP\) when Internet access is no longer required. After an EIP address is unbound, you still need to pay the retention fee. To avoid unnecessary cost, release the EIP after unbinding it.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/vpc). 
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Elastic IP Addresses**. 
3.  Select a region and find the target EIP. 
4.  Click **Unbind**, and then click **OK** in the displayed dialog. 
5.  After unbinding the EIP, click **More** \> **Release**, and then click **OK** in the displayed dialog box to release the EIP.
