2.  The EIP functions normally within15 days after the bill is overdue.
3.  The EIP service will be suspended after the bill is overdue more than 15 days.
4.  If the account is recharged with a sufficient amount of money in the 15 days before the EIP is released, the system will pay the overdue bill immediately and resume the EIP service. Otherwise, the EIP address will be released. The account owner will receive an email notification.
