# Overdue instructions {#concept_i5b_yl3_vdb .concept}

If an EIP bill is overdue, your service may be affected. Renew your EIP in time to avoid service interruption.

1.  If an EIP bill is overdue, or if your payment is not received, you will get an email.
2.  The EIP functions normally within 15 days after the bill is overdue.
3.  The EIP service will be suspended after the bill is overdue for more than 15 days.
4.  If the account is recharged with a sufficient amount of money 15 days after the service is suspended, the service is automatically restored. Otherwise, the EIP address will be released 15 days after the service is suspended. The account owner will receive an email notification.
