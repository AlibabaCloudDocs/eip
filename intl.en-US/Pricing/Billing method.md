# Billing method {#concept_645525 .concept}

Elastic IP Addresses \(EIPs\) are charged and billed on a Pay-As-You-Go basis.

## Pay-As-You-Go {#section_cby_imx_ale .section}

 The billing method of Pay-As-You-Go means you are billed after each EIP is used. Pay-As-You-Go EIPs are charged based on traffic. The Pay-As-You-Go EIP features are as follows:

-   You can release a Pay-As-You-Go EIP at any time. After a Pay-As-You-Go EIP is released, the bill for the last day or hour is generated and fees are deducted in the next day or hour. For more information, see [Release an EIP](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Manage Pay-As-You-Go-billed EIPs/Release an EIP.md#).
-   After an EIP is associated with an ECS instance in a VPC, the EIP is free from the instance fee. If the EIP is associated with a NAT Gateway, Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instance, secondary Elastic Network Interface \(ENI\), or High-Availability Virtual IP Address \(HaVip\), the instance fee is charged and billed.

For more information about the billing method of EIPs, see [Pay-As-You-Go](reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pay-As-You-Go.md#).
