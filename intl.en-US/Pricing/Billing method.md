# Billing method {#concept_645525 .concept}

Elastic IP Addresses \(EIPs\) are billed on a Pay-As-You-Go basis.

## Pay-As-You-Go {#section_cby_imx_ale .section}

Pay-As-You-Go is a billing method that allows you to use EIPs before payment for them is received. Pay-As-You-Go EIPs are billed by traffic. Pay-As-You-Go EIPs have the following characteristics:

-   You can release a Pay-As-You-Go EIP at any time. After a Pay-As-You-Go EIP is released, the bill for the last day or hour is generated and fees are deducted in the next day or hour. For more information, see [Release an EIP](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Manage Pay-As-You-Go-billed EIPs/Release an EIP.md#).
-   If the EIP is associated with an ECS instance of the VPC network, no instance fee is charged. If the EIP is associated with a NAT Gateway, an SLB instance, or an ENI, an instance fee is charged.

For information about the billing method of Pay-As-You-Go EIPs, see [Pay-As-You-Go](reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pay-As-You-Go.md#).
