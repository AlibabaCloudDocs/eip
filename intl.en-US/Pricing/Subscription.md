# Subscription

Elastic IP addresses \(EIPs\) support the subscription billing method. Subscription EIPs support only the pay-by-bandwidth metering method.

## Overview

Before you can use a subscription EIP, you must complete the payment of the subscription. Before you purchase subscription EIPs, take note of the following limits:

-   You must pay the subscription fee when you create a subscription EIP.
-   The billing cycle is one month.
-   You can only upgrade an EIP but cannot release it before the subscription expires.

## Billable items

You are charged only bandwidth fees when you use subscription EIPs.

Bandwidth fee = Bandwidth unit price \(USD/month\) × Subscription duration

## Bandwidth unit prices

EIPs support the following line types: BGP \(Multi-ISP\) and BGP \(Multi-ISP\) Pro. The bandwidth unit price of each line type is different.

**Note:** If the information about the regions and prices in the following table is different from that on the buy page in the console,the information on the [buy page](https://common-buy-intl.aliyun.com/?commodityCode=eip_pre_intl#/buy) shall prevail.
